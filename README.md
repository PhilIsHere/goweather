# goweather

goweather aims to provide a simple command line interface to get the current weather and forecast for a given location in Germany. The data is provided by the [Deutscher Wetterdienst](https://www.dwd.de/) via the [BrightSky API](https://brightsky.dev/).

The GPS coordinates are provided by the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) API.

The DWD ([Deutscher Wetterdienst](https://www.dwd.de/)), as Germany's
meteorological service, publishes a myriad of meteorological observations and
calculations as part of their [Open Data
program](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/opendata.html).

[**Bright Sky**](https://brightsky.dev/) is an open-source project aiming to
make some of the more popular data — in particular weather observations from
the DWD station network and weather forecasts from the MOSMIX model — available
in a free, simple JSON API.

## Usage
Download the binary from the release page and run it with the following command:
./goweather on Unix or .\goweather.exe on Windows

Please note that you need to cd into the directory where the binary is located.
